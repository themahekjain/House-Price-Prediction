PricePoint- House Price Prediction!

In the context of the dynamic real estate market, leveraging machine learning techniques presents a promising avenue for precise pricing predictions. Beginning with data acquisition from platforms like Kaggle, the project delves into comprehensive feature engineering to refine the dataset, encompassing tasks such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and preprocessing. Subsequently, the dataset is segregated into independent and dependent features, with the latter primarily focusing on property prices. The data is then further partitioned into training and testing sets to facilitate model development.
Various regression models are explored to ascertain the optimal approach, ultimately culminating in the selection of linear regression, which exhibits an impressive 88% accuracy. Following model creation, deployment into a web application is achieved through the utilization of the Flask framework in Python. Flask seamlessly integrates the linear regression model with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling user-friendly interaction with the predictive capabilities of the model.
In summary, this project encapsulates a holistic learning journey encompassing data handling, model fitting, accuracy assessment, and web deployment. Through this endeavor, a comprehensive understanding of machine learning's applicability in real estate pricing prediction is attained, fostering insights into the intricacies of this domain.
